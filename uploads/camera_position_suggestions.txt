Estimated vanishing point at: (8352, 116)

Vanishing Point Explanation:
The vanishing point suggests where parallel lines in the real world appear to converge.
This point is often useful for suggesting the central focus of the composition or the optimal view.

Suggested Camera Position: (8352, 300)
Suggested Camera Angle: -0.80Â°
Position Explanation:
Placing the camera around the suggested position helps capture the convergence of lines towards the vanishing point.
Positioning the camera one-third from the top aligns with the Rule of Thirds, enhancing visual balance.
The suggested angle aligns the camera to better capture the perspective lines towards the vanishing point.
